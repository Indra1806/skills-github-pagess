Explain the following text primarily based on the surrounding page content:
The isinstance() function returns True if its first argument is an instance of the second argument, and False otherwise:

Example Code
print(isinstance('Hello World', str)) # True
print(isinstance(42, int)) # True
Replace the current condition of your if statement with an isinstance() call. Pass in shift as the first argument, and int as the second argument.
